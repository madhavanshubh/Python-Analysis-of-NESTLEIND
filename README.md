The primary motive of this project is to make recommendations in relation to the financial health of the stock of Nestlé India Ltd. (NESTLEIND). In order to do this, the spot and future prices between 1st April ’19 to 30th March ’20 are to be analysed on the Daily, Weekly and Monthly Frequencies, so as to find out which investing methodology will work best in ensuring greater returns for the same amount of risk.

Apart from calculating Returns on the aforementioned frequencies, these Returns will also be adjusted with the Treasury-Bill Returns in order to calculate the Excess Returns. This is important as it paints a more realistic picture of the situation and helps an investor in making more informed decisions. 

Calculation of the Sharpe Ratio for each of these three frequencies will also help us in ascertaining the investment method which will give the best returns for the same amount of risk. Apart from the aforementioned work, Call Options are also interpreted using their Standard Deviations so that they can be compared with the actual quoted option prices. All analysis has been done through extensive usage of Python (using the Numpy, Pandas  and Matplotlib Libraries). The key observations from the analysis is that the highest Sharpe Ratio amongst stocks and futures was seen in the Far Month Futures Contracts, when investment was made on a Monthly Basis.
